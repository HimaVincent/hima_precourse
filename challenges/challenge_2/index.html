                <h2>About This Dish</h2>
                <p>
                  This recipe for steamed mussels in a spicy white wine sauce is a coastal style dish shared by my friend Jess. It combines fresh
                  mussels with tomatoes, chillies, warm spices and white wine to make a fragrant, comforting meal that is perfect with crusty bread or
                  rice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a great option when you want something that feels like a restaurant dish but is still simple enough for a weeknight dinner.
                </p>

                  <li>½ bottle dry white wine</li>
                  <li>Salt to taste (add only a small amount, as mussels are naturally salty)</li>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Clean the mussels.</strong> Rinse the mussels under cold running water. Scrub the shells to remove any grit and pull off
                    the beards. Discard any mussels with cracked shells or that do not close when tapped.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Start the base.</strong> Add the oil or butter to a large pot and heat over medium heat. Add the diced onions and
                    sautéuntil soft and translucent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Build the flavour.</strong> Stir in the ginger garlic paste, sliced chillies and chopped tomatoes. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes
                    until the tomatoes start to break down.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Add the spices.</strong> Mix in the turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder and peppercorns. Stir well to coat
                    everything and cook for another minute until fragrant.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Add liquid and reduce.</strong> Pour in the white wine and chicken stock. Stir and let the mixture simmer for 3 to 4
                    minutes so the wine reduces slightly and the sauce thickens a little.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cook the mussels.</strong> Add the cleaned mussels to the pot. Increase the heat to high, cover with a lid and cook for
                    about 10 minutes. Shake the pot occasionally so the mussels cook evenly.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Finish the dish.</strong> Once the mussels have opened, take the pot off the heat. Discard any mussels that stay closed.
                    Stir through the chopped coriander.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Serve.</strong> Spoon the mussels and the spicy white wine sauce into bowls, garnish with extra coriander and serve hot
                    with crusty bread or rice.
                  </li>
                </ol>
